  <p style="color:white; text-align:center" > 100 years ago, the earth got destroyed by radiation and everybody died. A lucky few escaped in time and they have been living on a space station. Now, the space station’s resources are almost gone so they send 100 people down to earth to see if it’s safe to live there now. When the 100 people reach, they realize it’s safe to live there but they also realize that they are not the only people who survived. How will they form relations with the people living on earth and how will they achieve peace.
