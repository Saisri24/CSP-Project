  <p style="margin-left: 20px; color:black; text-align:left;" > A fantasy show adaptation of Leigh Bardugo’s Shadow and Bone trilogy and the Six of Crows duology, Shadow and Bone combines characters from two timelines into one. Alina Starkov (played by Jessie Mei Li), orphan and cartographer, discovers a power that could unite the world, but many forces stand in her way, including: General Kirigan (played Ben Barnes), the main antagonist, and a trio of Ketterdam criminals–Kaz Brekker (played by Freddy Carter), Inej Ghafa (played by Amita Suman), and Jesper Fahey (played by Kit Young)--known as the Crows.

  <p style="margin-left: 20px; color:black; text-align:left;" > Although the show released its first season this year, it has blown me away. The cast is so diverse and reflects the characters’ nationalities and ethnicities incredibly in the show. The characters themselves are complex and well-developed. The character dynamics are also humorous and not too cliche. Also, Milo the goat. That is all.
