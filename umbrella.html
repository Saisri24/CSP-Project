    The narrator: On the 12th hour of the first day of October 1989, 43 women around the world gave birth. This was unusual only in the fact that none of these women had been pregnant when the day first began. Sir Reginald Hargreeves, eccentric billionaire and adventurer, resolved to locate and adopt as many of the children as possible.
    <br>
    Sir Reginald Hargreeves : [to one of the mothers]  Extraordinary! How much do you want for it? 
   <br>
   Title Card : He got seven of them.
    <br>
    These seven children would be raised by him to save the world. 
    Although the initial premise of the story seems cliche, the show itself explores the plot in surprising ways. I love how they captured the dynamics of the dysfunctional family with the main characters so well. Each of the main characters were relatable in their own ways and how their powers have their benefits and downsides.
