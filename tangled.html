  <p style="color:white; text-align:center" > An entertaining Disney movie about a girl who is exploring the world for the first time. Her mother has kept her locked up in her tower for her whole life. When Flynn Rider, a palace thief, stumbled upon her tower, she made him take her to the palace. Through that journey, she finds new friends, the truth about her family, adventure, and even love. Now this may seem boring, but a twist in the story is that Repunzel, the main character, has magic golden hair that glows when she sings a song. This movie is a perfect family entertainer and a perfect movie to watch with kids.
